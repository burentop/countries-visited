    <p>I wanted to have a separate page for Japan, because I spent so much of my time there. I lived in Japan for 2 1/2 years, and have also been
       back once for vacation. I have very fond memories, and feel like I actually kind of "grew up" in Japan - since it was my first job out of
       college.</p>
